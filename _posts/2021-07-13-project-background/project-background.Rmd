# Project Proposal Background
Taiwanâ€™s house prices continue to rise since many years ago, especially in the capital city - Taipei. Taipei is a city where has more job opportunities than other cities in Taiwan.
Buying a home remains unaffordable for most young Taiwanese. An average household in Taipei needs to pay two-thirds of its income for a mortgage loan. Most of the young adult who works in Taipei would buy/rent a house in neighbor cities of Taipei, and commute by car/bus/ train for 30 min to 1 hour every workday. It causes the house price in neighboring cities to continually increase.

**Keelung**, the city where I currently live, is one of the neighboring cities of Taipei but also the farthest one compares to other neighboring cities. I would like to analyze the house price changes in Keelung during these five years.

# Goals

- Keelung House price analysis

- Overall Price increase?

- County Average house price differences?
