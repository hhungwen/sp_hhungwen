Most of the young adult who works in Taipei would buy/rent a house in neighbor cities of Taipei, and commute by car/bus/ train for 30 min to 1 hour every workday. It causes the house price in neighboring cities to continually increase.\nKeelung, the city where I currently live, is one of the neighboring cities of Taipei but also the farthest one compares to other neighboring cities. I would like to analyze the house price changes in Keelung during these five years.\nGoals\nKeelung House price analysis\nOverall Price increase?\nCounty Average house price differences?\n\n\n\n",
